### List of files

* [airsea_flux](airsea_flux.ipynb) - **Calculations for air-sea fluxes of oxygen.** Fluxes are calculated with the Liang et al. (2013) parameterization, adjusting bubble components by a factor of $\beta$ = 1.5. Includes code for producing Fig. 1a-c, Fig. 2a, and Fig. 4

* [isopycnal_oxygen](isopycnal_oxygen.ipynb) - **Calculations for oxygen changes in isopycnal layers.** Includes code for producing Fig. 5 and the blue line in Fig. 4b. Code for Fig. 6 to be added later
